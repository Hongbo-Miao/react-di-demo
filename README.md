# React DI

Demo from my blog post ["Implementing Angular's Dependency Injection in React. Understanding Element Injectors."](http://blog.mgechev.com/2017/01/30/implementing-dependency-injection-react-angular-element-injectors/).

The original of this minesweeper can be found here [https://github.com/shibe97/React-MineSweeper](https://github.com/shibe97/React-MineSweeper).
